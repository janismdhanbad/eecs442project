# GradCAM4YOLO
GradCAM algorithm implementation for YOLOv3 in PyTorch 1.4

This is a fork of [utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations), specifially the GradCAM module intended to work with YOLOv3 to visualize its most important regions of input to predict classes.
